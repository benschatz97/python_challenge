# python_challenge

I utilized 3 tutoring sessions for this homework.  This first tutoring session was basically spent setting up the process for github.  I was having a lot of trouble with this initially as github was not recognizing my computer or email address.  This was corrected in the tutoring session.

The second two tutoring sessions were spent tinkering with the syntax of the code for each half of the assignment.  the tutor liked the process I was working with be helped me better set up variables to reach my desired result.
